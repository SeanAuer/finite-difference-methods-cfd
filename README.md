## Finite Difference Methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics ##

This set of Jupyter Notebooks intends to cover content required for building understanding in how Finite Difference Methods are employed to solve fluid dynamics problems computationally.

Given a set of common fluid dynamics governing equations to describe the physics of a given flow problem  
- Potential Flow
- Transport Equations
- The Wave Equation
- The Euler Equations
- The Navier-Stokes Equations  

This course endeavors to make the reader aware of the components of the governing equation, the discretization options available, the implications of dimensionality of the problem (1-D, 2-D, 3-D), and a study of the consequences of employment of a numerical method such as truncation errors, stability analysis, convergeance, etc.
