## Overview

This set of Jupyter Notebooks is designed to build a foundational understanding of how **Finite Difference Methods (FDM)** are used to computationally solve problems in fluid dynamics.

We focus on a set of commonly encountered governing equations that describe the physics of fluid flows:

- **Potential Flow**  
- **Transport Equations**  
- **The Wave Equation**  
- **The Euler Equations**  
- **The Navier‚ÄìStokes Equations**

## Objectives

Throughout this course, the goal is to help the reader develop insight into:

- The structure and components of each governing equation  
- Discretization techniques and their application  
- The role of problem dimensionality (**1-D**, **2-D**, **3-D**)  
- Key numerical considerations, including:
  - Truncation error  
  - Stability analysis  
  - Convergence behavior  

Whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer, this series aims to bridge theoretical fluid dynamics with practical numerical implementation.

## What Are Finite Difference Methods?

Finite Difference Methods (FDM) are a class of numerical techniques used to approximate the solutions of differential equations by replacing derivatives with algebraic difference equations.  

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \quad \longrightarrow \quad \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta x}
$$  

These approximations are grounded in the **physical interpretation of a derivative**‚Äîthe rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. A classic example is the **forward difference**, derived from the definition of the derivative:

$$
\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

To construct a usable numerical method, we **drop the limit** and treat $\Delta x$ as a small but finite step size. This yields an approximation:

$$
\frac{d f(x)}{d x} \approx \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This is known as the **forward difference formula**, so called because for $\Delta x$ > 0, each 'step' in x is seen as moving 'forward,' or to the right on an x-axis, and it becomes more accurate as $\Delta x$ becomes smaller.

In numerical applications, the function is assumed to be defined only at a set of **discrete grid points**, such as:

$$
x = [x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots] = [0, \Delta x, 2\Delta x, 3\Delta x, \dots]
$$

Derivatives are then approximated using values at neighboring grid points. For example, the derivative at a point $x_i$ might be approximated using $f(x_{i+1})$ and $f(x_i)$ (forward difference), or $f(x_{i-1})$ and $f(x_i)$ (backward difference), or a symmetric combination (central difference).

This shift from **continuous calculus** to **discrete algebra** allows us to transform differential equations into systems of equations that can be solved using a computer.


### Finite Difference Approximations

To solve differential equations numerically, we replace calculus-based derivatives with **algebraic approximations** on a discrete grid ‚Äî this is the foundation of **Finite Difference Methods (FDM)**.

Let $\phi_i = \phi(x_i)$ be the value of a function at point $x_i$, with uniform grid spacing $\Delta x$.

###  **First Derivative: $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$**

| Method | Approximation | Order |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Forward Difference** | $\displaystyle \frac{\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i}{\Delta x}$ | ùí™($\Delta x$) |
| **Backward Difference** | $\displaystyle \frac{\phi_i - \phi_{i-1}}{\Delta x}$ | ùí™($\Delta x$) |
| **Central Difference** | $\displaystyle \frac{\phi_{i+1} - \phi_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$ | ùí™($\Delta x^2$) |

### **Second Derivative: $\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}$**

| Method               | Approximation                                                             | Order         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Forward-biased**   | $\displaystyle \frac{-\phi_{i+2} + 4\phi_{i+1} - 5\phi_i + 2\phi_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}$ | ùí™($\Delta x^2$) |
| **Backward-biased**  | $\displaystyle \frac{-\phi_{i-2} + 4\phi_{i-1} - 5\phi_i + 2\phi_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2}$ | ùí™($\Delta x^2$) |
| **Central Difference** | $\displaystyle \frac{\phi_{i+1} - 2\phi_i + \phi_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}$              | ùí™($\Delta x^2$) |
| **Five-Point Stencil** *(optional)* | $\displaystyle \frac{-\phi_{i+2} + 16\phi_{i+1} - 30\phi_i + 16\phi_{i-1} - \phi_{i-2}}{12\Delta x^2}$ | ùí™($\Delta x^4$) |



**üîç What does "Order" mean?**  
The *order of a finite difference method* tells us how the error behaves as we shrink the grid spacing $\Delta x$.  
- A method with **ùí™($\Delta x$)** error (first-order) means halving the grid spacing cuts the error in half.
- A method with **ùí™($\Delta x^2$)** error (second-order) means halving the grid spacing cuts the error by a factor of **four**.
- Higher order = faster convergence as the grid gets finer.

> We are not doing calculus on functions ‚Äî we are using **algebraic approximations** to estimate derivatives using values at nearby grid points.

These finite difference formulas form the building blocks of all the numerical solvers used in this project.

### Real-World Applications of FDM

While more advanced solvers today use Finite Volume or Finite Element Methods, FDM remains foundational in many fields, especially for prototyping, reduced-order modeling, and education.

Notable uses of FDM:
- **Early CFD solvers** (e.g., early NASA tools like NASTRAN prototypes)
- **Weather models** from institutions like **NOAA**
- **Educational tools** for aerospace and mechanical engineers
- **Embedded systems** or fast solvers where memory constraints require lightweight numerical schemes

FDM also plays a critical role in validating results from more complex solvers by offering analytically traceable approximations.
